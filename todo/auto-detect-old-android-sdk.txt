TODO: Drop the GEMMLOWP_USE_OLD_ANDROID_SDK manually defined token

Platforms: Android

Coding time: S
Experimentation time: S
Skill required: S

Model to follow/adapt:
  GEMMLOWP_USE_MEMALIGN in internal/allocator.h

At the moment, support for old Android SDKs where <cstdint> is missing is
ensured by manually defining a preprocessor token,
GEMMLOWP_USE_OLD_ANDROID_SDK. It would be much better to automatically
define those old Android SDKs, in the same way as we already do in
internal/allocator.h for GEMMLOWP_USE_MEMALIGN.
